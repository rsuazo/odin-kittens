## Building a Simple Kittens API

This is a fast and straightforward project where you’ll set up a Rails app to be a data-producing API… which is just a fancy way of saying that all your controller methods will render data instead of HTML. Consider this a drill in quickly building a pure vanilla RESTful resource. We won’t be working with an external API until the next project.

### Your Task

#### HTML

We’ll start by building our Kitten application to work normally in the browser with HTML.

1. Set up a new Rails application (odin-kittens) and Git repo.
2. Update the README to describe the application and link back to this project

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
